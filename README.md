This project was made out of pure fun, the software is strictly made for linux kernel user, but if needed and on demand i can make a windows version, the software baseicly trys to imitate the sound of the famous song Rush-E.
The file is compiled and all users have to do is to run the .exe file in the terminal Found in the  cmake-build-debugg folder in the main folder.
Other instructions can be found in the source code, witch anybody is free to edit as they want.
At the botton in the main function there is variable named loop_cont, by changing that number you can increase the number of loops made by the song.
Hope everybody like my little music-software project.
